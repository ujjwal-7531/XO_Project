# XO_Project
This is a project on the famous tic-tac-toe game using C++.

This is a new branch with feature to detect if a player is using any sort of false move like
grid position is out of bound i.e. >9 or <1 OR if they are selecting position which is already played.<br>In any of the above scenario the program terminates.
